##pwapwa is an easy-to use javascript library to display Google Picasa Web albums in your website.###UseUsage is easy (check the included example.html for an example). Include this javascript code in your head tag:    <script type="text/javascript">		username='gentlefoto'; // your PicasaWeb user name here 		photosize='800'; 		columns='4';		nextText = 'next';		previousText = 'previous';		albumText = 'album';		autoplay = true; // autoplay video	</script>    <script type="text/javascript" src="./pwa.js"></script>###Options* username: this is the username of your PicasaWeb account* photosize: the size to display single images* columns: the amount of columns to display all albums and all images in an album* nextText: the text of the 'next' link* previousText: the text of the 'previous' link* albumText: the text of the 'album' link* autoplay: true if you want videos to start playing automatically	###Upcoming featuresWhen I find the time, I would like to add:* Flash support for videos (working on it now, experimental)* Add more options for translation, link texts, link images (i.e. for previous and next links),...* Easily show just one album* Easily show a slideshow (that might be a separate script)* Change usage so you don't have to add the code in your head tag, but anywhere you want the albums to appear.* A better way of passing options (not via global variables)###OriginThe script is based on the pwa script by Jesse Berman and Dieter Raber. The modifications I made were mainly to support videos. Afterwards, extras were added like using divs and css instead of tables.###My contact details:* [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/petermorlion)* [GitHub](http://github.com/petermorlion)* [Blog](http://petermorlion.blogspot.com)Dieter Raber's email address is mentioned in the script (dieter@dieterraber.net), but I couldn't reach him (my emails bounced).
